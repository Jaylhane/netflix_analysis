# netflix_analysis
An MVP version of a dashboard to analyze a small NETFLIX dataset.

<br />
This project was developed for a selection process. Despite having passed the technical test, the contract was not carried out, so I am making the result available to compose my portfolio. I hope you like the result.

In this repository it's possible find the guidance questions and my answers. <br />
